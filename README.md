The **Yearly Commit Calendar** is a simple visualization tool that displays a year's worth of commit activity in a calendar format. Each day is represented by a square, and the color intensity of the square reflects the level of activity for that day.

## Features
- Displays a yearly calendar with daily commit activity.
- Uses color gradients to represent different levels of commit activity:
  - **No commits**: Light gray (`#ebedf0`)
  - **Low activity**: Light green (`#c6e48b`)
  - **Medium activity**: Green (`#7bc96f`)
  - **High activity**: Dark green (`#239a3b`)
  - **Very high activity**: Darkest green (`#196127`)
- Includes a legend to explain the color coding.
- Generates random commit data for demonstration purposes.
